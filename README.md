# Zenika Career Paths framework

The Zenika Career Paths framework is meant to help our collaborators customize their sought goals to develop their impact in the industry.

## Inception & Goals

The first version of the Career Paths framework was created out of necessity: career management has to be implemented in any organization to fairly assess the impact of each collaborator and provide them clear guidelines to grow within the organization.

However, there are a few pitfalls to take into account:
- In a flat organization, career growth cannot be reflected by titles alone
- Individuals rarely appreciate being labeled or put in boxes
- Career growth is seldom vertical in our industry
  - Practices evolve at a fast rate (techniques, technologies, organizational models, methodologies...)
  - When "promoted", people are not being asked to "do the same thing in a better way"
  - The managerial path is not so Golden anymore

Given these, we aimed for a framework that would:
- Break down and appreciate the value a collaborator can provide in pre-identified meaningful areas
- Identify in which specific areas they would like to grow
- Reflect their particularities as much as possible

The sought outcomes of using our framework were:
- Help collaborators figure out their Hatarakigai / 働きがい / Worth of Working (or [Ikigai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai) if work is part of it)
- Help them own and shape their career as they see fit
- Help the organization appreciate the diversity of profiles with a structured approach and provide growth support accordingly


## Concept

Through multiple iterations, we ended up with a framework with 6 paths where one can grow their impact:
1. __Practices & their related Domains__: through concrete techniques and knowledge
2. __Delivery__: through optimizing production outputs
3. __Leadership__: through moving teams towards clear inspiring goals
4. __Business__: through developing meaningful connections and opportunities for work
5. __Architecture__: through leading construction work
6. __Posture__: through positively influencing one's ecosystem

And since we need to introduce the idea of "growth", steps or milestones are defined for each path.

This led to the following model:

Of course:
- We need to appreciate where the collaborator is and what he likes doing before targeting growth
- One individual is not limited to one path: they can grow on multiple paths at the same time

But we were not completely satisfied with the customization potential yet

The reason was that: if you had two local experts in React.js, how can you expose their specificities further? For this, we decided to add the concept of __Colours__ to the mix.

A color is applied to a step to reflect an outstanding particularity.

In the case of our React.js experts, one may focus a lot on __Cloud__ integration while the other one might focus more on __Craftsmanship__.

The colours make their specificities stand out. Since they are very context-bound, we decided that the colours should be free from constraints.

However, we did create a list to provide some common __Colours__ one can usually find in drawn Career Paths:

This should hopefully give you a first idea of what our framework is.
