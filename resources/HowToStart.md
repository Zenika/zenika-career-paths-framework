# How to start with the CareerPath in your organization


## Before starting

The CareerPath is a framework, is part of the whole management process. This is a key point.
Doing the CareerPath is not a goal, it's a way to reach your goal. So the first question to ask yourself is : "What do you want to acheive ?"
Do you expect to transform your organisation, do you expect to find valuable personn to acheive an objective, do you want a diagnostic of your team, ....



## Process

The CareerPath process can be setup in 4 distinct steps, depending of the personn and the objective you have.
 - the _auto-diagnostic_, the persons (helped by a faciliator) will fill theirs path according to their experience.
 - the _check with the reality_ , the persons (helped by someone who hae informations, facts, comming from the customers, colleagues, projects ...) with the manager (as example) will discuss if the auto-diagnostic match the others percetion. It's similar to all 360's approach.
 - _Define the target_, the personns will define their next steps, were they want to make progress, what they want to explore.
 - _Make the plan_ , he personnes will define (with manager, HR,...) to steps to reach their personnal target.

All the steps requires specific skill to help the personne in this path:
- In the _auto_diagnostic_, the challenge is to define your position relatively to others. The exercise is difficult, often the personn either under estimate their value, or over estimate it.
- In the _check with the reality_, being conscious of their real value can be disturbing. They can have some good suprise, or the reality may hurt.
- In the _define the target_, defining a target may be diffcult. Defining objective, sharing internal motivation (and even knowing them) is not so common.
- In the _Make the plan_, defining SMART objectives is a challenge and not so easy to do.


## Exemples of next steps



Let's take an exemple. A front end developper, specialist of Angular. His target is to be able to diagnose front end systems.
He has lot of topics to learn or develop :
 - in order to have a global front end culture in need to have at least basic practice level in  VueJs, React, ...
 - in order to share is diganosis he need to develop synthesis capacity;
 - in order to diagnose, is should learn interview, communication, facilitation, ....
 - he should also have in mind than devops and backend practices will help to do a good job.

So, it's not a 6 month plan. Defining baby steps, with clear objective may make sens. The whole process may take several years. And of course, the target may change over time.  I think, keeping this in mind, is a key point to embrace the change.

## From the individu to the organisation

The diagnostic part will help you to match your organisation strengh regarding the challenges you have to adress.
You can build a _radar_ of your teams, and compare it to what you need. From this point you may either help your team to learn the missing skill, or addapt your recrutment plan.

The define the target, is a balance between the personnal dreams, and the organisation goal. Sharing with the teams the organisation challenge may help them to identify opportunity.
A common mistake i saw in organisation, is manager have 'ideas' of who wants to go in a direction or who can go in a direction. My personnal position today, is by doing that you avoid lot of good surprise.  Motivation is a key point during a change, so i prefer to have motivated people instead of people that _can do_ the job.
