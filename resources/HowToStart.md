# How to start with the Career Paths framework in your organization


## Before starting

The Career Paths, as a framework, is part of the whole management process. This is a key point.
Running a Career Paths session is not a goal, it is a way to reach your goal.
So the first question to ask yourself is: "What do you want to achieve?"
Do you expect to transform your organisation? Are you looking for valuable persons to reach an objective? Do you want to diagnose your team?...


## Process

The Career Paths process can be set in 4 distinct steps, depending of the teams and the objectives you have.
 - _Self-diagnostic_, the persons (helped by a faciliator) will fill their paths according to their experience.
 - _Reality check_, the persons (helped by someone who has information, facts, feedback from customers, colleagues, projects...) with the manager (as an example) will discuss if the auto-diagnostic matches the facts. We can compare this step to the 360's approach.
 - _Target definition_, the persons will define their next steps where they want to make progress, what they want to explore.
 - _Planning_, the persons will define (with management, HR...) the steps to reach their personnal targets.

The above steps require specific skills:
- For the _auto_diagnostic_ step, the challenge is to define your position relatively to others. The exercise is difficult, the person often either underestimates their value or overestimates it.
- For the _reality check_ step, being conscious of their real value can be disturbing. They may have some good suprises or the reality may hurt.
- For the _target definition_ step, clarification may be difficult. Defining objectives, being aware of and sharing one's internal motivation are not so common.
- For the _planning_ step, defining SMART objectives is a challenge of its own.


## Exemples of next steps

Let's take an exemple. A front end developper, specialist of Angular. His target is to be able to diagnose front end systems.
He has lot of topics to learn or develop :
 - in order to have a global front end culture in need to have at least basic practice level in  VueJs, React, ...
 - in order to share is diganosis he need to develop synthesis capacity;
 - in order to diagnose, is should learn interview, communication, facilitation, ....
 - he should also have in mind than devops and backend practices will help to do a good job.

So, it's not a 6 month plan. Defining baby steps, with clear objective may make sens. The whole process may take several years. And of course, the target may change over time.  I think, keeping this in mind, is a key point to embrace the change.

## From the individu to the organisation

The diagnostic part will help you to match your organisation strengh regarding the challenges you have to adress.
You can build a _radar_ of your teams, and compare it to what you need. From this point you may either help your team to learn the missing skill, or addapt your recrutment plan.

The define the target, is a balance between the personnal dreams, and the organisation goal. Sharing with the teams the organisation challenges may help them to identify new opportunities.
A common mistake in organisation, is manager have 'ideas' of who wants to go in a direction or who can go in a direction. By doing that you avoid lot of good surprise, prevent people to volunter, and even worse you may generate frustation as new oppportunities are propose all the time to the same subset of people.  Motivation is a key point during a change, so focus on involving people instead of focusing finding people that _can do_ the job.
