# Delivery path

## Path breakdown

The Delivery path is about supplying - or giving birth to - desired outputs or outcomes.

Delivering relies on the orchestration of strategic decisions and tactical actions.
- Tactics provide contextual proofs of feasibility for strategies
- Strategies allow for quicker and more impactful tactical decisions

When we designed that path's steps, we drew some inspiration from project and product management:
1. __Analyst__: focus on data
2. __Planner__: focus on contingencies
3. __Operator__: focus on execution
4. __Strategist__: focus on optimization

The progression steps came in that particular order since we believe that:
- A Strategist can optimize execution only if they know about the perception of things on the field
- An Operator can execute with unforeseen constraints only if they can plan in real-time
- A Planner can plan ahead only if they can qualify good intelligence


On a side note, we also found out that people performing in that particular path are usually:
- __Driven__ with a solution-focused mindset
- __Adaptable__ to fast change with real-time analysis reflexes
- __People-oriented__ with a conflict-solving attitude
