# Leadership path

## Path breakdown

The Leadership path focuses on teams dynamics.

_Leadership_ is not to be confused with _management_.
One is about _"conducting, guiding, being the first"_, the other one is about _"handling, touching, maneuvering"_.
However, we do have a "Management Lead" step in this path because _working on the maneuvers underlying principles_ (‚â† maneuvering) is an advanced milestone.

Leaders use different techniques to bring a team to a certain targeted state.

However, they always require the same strong foundation to steer teams:
- Ability to listen and empathize
- Ability to inspire and clarify
- Ability to empower and contribute
- Ability to set up feedback loops and other communication channels
- Ability to display confidence and comforting authority

From an operational standpoint, leaders will usually:
- Determine and clarify current team goals
- Assess and provide the necessary resources to reach these
- Get continuous feedback to adjust the resources and/or the goals
