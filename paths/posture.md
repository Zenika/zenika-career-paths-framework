# Posture path

## Path breakdown

The Posture path focuses on personal capabilities.

_Posture_ might be the most difficult path to explain, as it is largely covered in the literature and the word has so many meanings depending on the authors.
So we first tried to clarify what we call _Posture_ in our context.

_Posture_ is our ability to use different techniques to bring a team or an individual to a certain targeted state or to reach a pre-defined objective.
Over time, the initial plan or the targeted state often change. But any necessary adaptations can also be made consciously with the right timing.

However, this requires some strong foundation:
- Ability to listen and learn
- Ability to teach and explain
- Ability to empower and contribute
- Ability to summarize and take decisions
- Ability to display confidence and comforting authority

From an operational standpoint, a _posture_ will usually help us to:
- Help individuals, teams or organisations to reach a target
- Get continuous feedback to adjust the posture we use in our operational context

## Overview

The _posture_ will reflect our ability to have the right behavior, to use the rigth tools at the right moment and with the right persons. The objective is to find a good balance between listening, helping and acting ourselves.

## Steps Details

### Doer

The __Doer__ posture marks the beginning of the path.

Doers are able to:
- Follow a plan, an order, an idea...
- Change course in case something goes wrong


### Consultant

Consultants are at the next level. They have the ability to go beyond simple task execution.

They also showcase the following:
- Ability to communicate clearly with objectives' stakeholders
- Ability to go from what has been 'asked' to be done to the (real) need
- Ability to identify bottlenecks before they congest a context


From this point onward, there are 3 dictinct paths. They overlap each other to some extent, as helping individuals or groups requires some fundamental techniques.

### Mentor

The mentor, is the ability to help others, by listening them, protect them, by avoiding them to be in trouble.
It's what we call a _low_ posture.
I used to explain it, often, as the 'mountain guide', that walk with you, providing you advice, but you are the owner of the path you choose to follow.
The guide is there to ensure your success, but he's not accountable for it, as he do not control the key part of the success.
They also showcase the following:
- Ability to listen and to questionnate
- Ability to not influence by its own feeling the mentoree
- Ability to suggest neutral idea
- Ability to define the rules and the limites of the coaching support

### Facilitator

The facilitator, is (not only an agile facilitator) a personn who have the capacity to etract the collective knowledge of an individual or a group to find a solution or a problem.

They also showcase the following:
- Ability to drive a group
- Ability to be focussed on the solution
- Ability questionnate
- Ability to summarized, reformulate idea, opinion


### Lecturer and trainer

This sub path, is the ability to transfer knowledge from one personn to another one. It's a _high_ (top?) posture where one person.
Be carefull, a good teacher alternate the _trainer_ and the _mentor_ posture during a teaching session.

The first step, _lecturer_, is the ability to deliver a knowledge, but the _trainer_ as also the capacity to build the training path according to the student.

They also showcase the following:
- Ability to share, transfert a knowledge
- Ability to construct a learning path adapted to the trainee
- Ability to adapt the training to the specificities of the trainnee.


### Coach

The _coach_, is the personn who have the capacity to use one of the previous posture in order to acheive his objective.
He has the control of the posture, and use it on purpose. It requires a deep knowledge of our internal motivation, what's drive us, what's drive a group of people.
Going at this level, means we have a deep control of our natural behavior. This may generate stress and tiredness or euphory as the job may be exiting and challenging. Burnout may be due also of too much (euphoric) activities.

The progress in this direction, if often an guided progression, as _hypervision_ (work activities made in group of same level people) or _supervision_ (a senior help you to analse what's happen in the past, and help you to think about the futur) are key parts of this role.

They also showcase the following:
- Ability to decide (in real time) which posture is the most suitable to reach the objective
- Ability to explain a situation
- Ability to find a set of solution to a problem
- Ability to ask for help when needed
- Ability to take care of himself


### Influencer

As the previous paths, we values the capacities to share he knowledge. So, in our path, the capacity to share, promote a knowledge or  a practice, with a deep analasys on how it works and why, may have a significant impact.

The _influener_ should masterise the _logos_ (logical part of the message, what make sens and the most relevant arguments), the _ethos_ (the messanger, it's important to devellop our sympathy, we must be confident and honorable) and the _pathos_ (the emotional part of the message, we develop emotion in the listeners group).  Beginner may focus on only one aspect of the message, but these three parts are important.

They also showcase the following:
- Ability to engage people in a path, a change or a transformation
- Ability to share and explain his/her convictions.
