# Posture path

## Path breakdown

The Posture path focuses on personnal capacities.

_Posure_ is may be the most difficult to explain, as it's covered largelly in the litterature, and the word have so many meaning depending on the author.

_Posture_ is our ability to use different techniques to bring a team or an individual to a certain targeted state.

However, they always require the same strong foundation to steer teams:
- Ability to listen
- Ability to teach and learn
- Ability to empower and contribute
- Ability to summarize and took decision
- Ability to set up feedback loops and other communication channels
- Ability to display confidence and comforting authority

From an operational standpoint, _the posture_ will help us to usually:
- help individual, teams or organisation to reach a point
- Get continuous feedback to adjust the posture we use in the context

It's what we call a _low_ posture.
I used to explain it, often, as the 'mountain guide', that walk with you, providing you advice, but you are the owner of the path you choose to follow.
The guide is there to ensure your success, but he's not accountable for it, as he do not control the key part of the success.
