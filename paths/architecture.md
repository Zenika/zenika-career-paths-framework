# Architecture path

## Path breakdown

The Architecture path is somewhat special as most people do not think of themselves as architects at first glance.

But the word Architect simply means: __Lead (ἀρχι - archi) Builder (τέκτων - téktōn)__.

The _τέκτων_ part can actually be interpreted in many ways itself:
- carpenter, builder
- crafter, master of art (e.g. woodworking, gymnastics, poetry, medicine, engineering...)
- author, creator, planner

Bottom line, an architect is leading construction / creative work, which involves planning, designing and decision making.

In our industry, we can for example meet architects of:
- Digital transformations
- Organizations
- Softwares
- Data
- Businesses
- Enterprise IT
- ...

But all these types of architects share the same fundamental abilities:
- Ability to map / draw blueprints of current states and principles of workable systems
- Ability to provide options for "better" states or principles
- Ability to draw clear trajectories towards targeted states or principles


In order to grow in that path, we designed 4 different scales we thought relevant for any type of architect:
- __Module__: focus on designing modules - units that can function independently from any external constraints
- __Platform__: focus on designing platforms - integrated heterogenous modules making up workable systems
- __Program__: focus on rationalizing programs - tailored principles that facilitate systems creations
- __Company__: focus on (re)defining companies - culture influencing all levels involved in systems creations

An Enterprise Architect is therefore not necessarily at the level of a Company-scaled Architect.
If they only draw trajectories that fit management requirements without taking into accounts engineering constraings, they may still function as Module-scaled Architects.
