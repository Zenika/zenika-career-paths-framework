# Practices & related Domains path


## Path breakdown and representation

When it comes to making an impact through your Functional Skills, we have settled for 2 directions to grow at the same time:
- Through __Techniques__ mastery => __Practice Expertise__
- Through __Knowledge__ development => __Domain Expertise__

In the framework, we group Practices per Domain.

You may represent each Domain as a growing flower:
- The length of the stem gives you the first level of impact through the overall Domain knowledge.
- The length of each petal gives you the level of impact for each specific Practice.

For example:
- A Front-End Developer could specialize in __React__, __Node.js__ and __Spring MVC__ within the __Web Development__ domain and position themselves as a __Domain Lead__ on that particular domain:

- An Agile Coach could specialize in __Liberating Structures__, __Lego Serious Play__ and __Appreciative Inquiry__ within the __Facilitation__ domain and position themselves as __Domain Butterfly__ on that particular domain:

The __Practices and related Domains__ path is the only one that can spawn multiple "sub-paths" and this is the reason why we are modeling it differently than the more linear others.

Practices are completely dependant of the Domain of expertise of each collaborator.

We wanted the manipulated terms to be as generic as possible to make them applicable to both Zenika front-office and back-office staff.
